# User heard about biodb app and decide to visit this website. Received adress
# leads him to welcome page. Welcome page contains welcome message, login form
# with two fields and link to sign up form.

# Excited user clicks sign up link. He noticed new form with several fields:
# username, email adress, password and repeat password.

# Distracted user accidentaly clicks submit button before fill any field. Every
# field is requried so now he sees error messages bound with any field.

# Immediately decides to repair his mistake and starts to fill the form with
# data. But he dont know that user with such username, email and password
# already exists in database. He quickly learns about it when hr clicks submit
# button. Above every field now appear message with appropriate message:
# 'user with such <field> already exists'.

# User fills form with new data and clicks submit button once again. Success! He
# is redirected to a welcome page.
